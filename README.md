Hi there,
This project is a host scanner and a get & post simulator with socket programming.
Actualy this phase has three parts:
1) Host status checker: Enter the host IP that you want to check and find out it's online or not.
2) Host open ports scanner: Scan open ports and processes on the host.
3) Simulation of packet get and post protocols in http.
